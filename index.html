            <ul>
              <li>
                Contributed to the development of an internal web platform used
                by corporate training teams to manage course materials, assign
                learning paths, and monitor progress across departments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built responsive and modular UI components using
                <span class="white bold">React, JavaScript</span>, and
                <span class="white bold">CSS Modules</span>, following reusable
                patterns to support features like progress bars, quizzes, and
                certificate previews.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assisted in building stateful components and managing shared
                state across the app using
                <span class="white bold">Context API</span>, learning best
                practices for component composition and prop drilling
                mitigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborated with senior developers to integrate REST APIs using
                axios, rendering dynamic content such as user learning paths and
                quiz results.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wrote utility functions and helper components to support file
                uploads (PDFs, Docs) and image previews within course material
                sections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Participated in sprint planning and daily standups, gaining

                Jira and Gitlab.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performed debugging and optimization using React DevTools and

                re-renders in tabular course lists.
